        <h3>The Stone Age</h3>
        <img src="stoneage.jpg" alt="stoneage">
        <p>It marks a period of prehistory in which humans used primitive stone tools. <br> Lasting
            roughly 2.5 million years, the Stone Age ended around 5,000 years ago when humans <br>
            in the Near East began working with metal and making tools and weapons from bronze.

        <h3>The Bronze Age</h3>
        <img src="bronzeage.jpg" alt="bronzeage">
        <p>Spanned from 3,300 to 1,200 BCE and is characterized by the use of copper and its alloy bronze
            as <br> the chief hard materials in the manufacturing of implements and weapons. This period
            ended with <br> further advancements in metallurgy, such as the ability to smelt iron ore.

        <h3>The Iron Age</h3>
        <img src="ironage.png" alt="ironage">
        <p>A period in human history that started between 1200 B.C. and 600 B. C., depending on the region, <br>
           and followed the Stone Age and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, people across much of Europe, <br>
           Asia and parts of Africa began making tools and weapons from iron and steel. For some societies, <br>
           including Ancient Greece, the start of the Iron Age was accompanied by a period of cultural
           decline.
